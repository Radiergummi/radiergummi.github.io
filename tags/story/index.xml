Currently, we have lots of SEO-relevant aggregation pages and public profiles we&amp;rsquo;re not immediately ready to move to the new application. These pages are automatically generated from our old application server, receive serious traffic (40k views per day), and cannot be replicated in Webflow, our new website provider.
Unfortunately, those pages are all placed on the root domain (matchory.</description></item><item><title>Change of Plans</title><link>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/change-of-plans/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 15:41:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/change-of-plans/</guid><description>Starting this september, I will join Matchory as head of engineering and help them revolutionize the global manufacturing market.
As it goes with most big changes in life, I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice what was happening until all puzzle pieces were in place. My original plan for 2020 (looking back this is a silly thing to say, with this specific year probably accounting for the highest number of cancelled plans in recent and not-so-recent history) was to start looking at the job market around August, probably making a decision in late october, and get moving sometime before the holidays.</description></item><item><title>Taking user feedback seriously</title><link>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/user-feedback/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 12:03:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/user-feedback/</guid><description>Recently, I got annoyed with the way we handle support in some cases. Users write emails or send messages via instant messaging apps, which end up in some ticket system, get assigned a priority and will be forwarded as a ticket to a support employee. Maybe they don&amp;rsquo;t have time right away because they are busy or on vacation or don&amp;rsquo;t like the customer or simply aren&amp;rsquo;t too motivated that day.</description></item><item><title>Automatically deployed feature branch previews</title><link>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/feature-branch-previews/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 13:12:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/feature-branch-previews/</guid><description>Automatically deployed feature branch previews At MessengerPeople , we have employed a pretty strict branching schema:

Every Release is a tag on master, every new development takes place in a new branch.</description></item><item><title>Embracing Imperfection</title><link>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/embracing-imperfection/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2020 10:54:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/embracing-imperfection/</guid><description>Ah, source code. Usually, and especially if written by someone else, it&amp;rsquo;s awful . If you suffer from even a slight proclivity to perfectionism, you will inevitably try to refactor it. While doing so, you will equally inevitably realize there&amp;rsquo;s even bigger fruits to reap a little further up, and before you know it you&amp;rsquo;re rewriting the entire application. Now, the younger me might have said, &amp;ldquo;obviously that was necessary!&amp;rdquo;, utterly ignoring the fact that the end result performs equally well at best, with a ridiculous amount of time having been wasted on playing a zero-sum game.</description></item><item><title>Simple Cronjobs for CLI apps using systemd</title><link>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/php-cronjobs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 13:29:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/php-cronjobs/</guid><description>Most applications will need some kind of asynchronous processing happening in the background: Calculating statistics, sending emails or processing large files. These tasks are probably abstracted into some kind of job queue, ready to be fetched by a worker.
Now, whenever you want to perform a task in regular intervals (say: Calculating monthly billing positions and sending them to Stripe for invoicing), you need some kind of scheduler. The most straightforward and probably most common solution is to simply create a cron job.</description></item><item><title>Hello World!</title><link>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2020 20:54:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>Hello darkness, my old friend&amp;hellip;
This is not the first time I&amp;rsquo;m attempting to write regularly. As it usually happens, you start enthusiastically with a thought or twice at the edge of your brain, eager to be put in words, thinking &amp;ldquo;Oh yeah! This time, I&amp;rsquo;m going to do it! I&amp;rsquo;m finally making a blog!&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; until you actually start doing so.
Now, in my previous attempts, one of two things might happen:</description></item></channel></rss>
