x: Merge/Branch
o: Commit
</code></pre><p>There&rsquo;s a <em>single</em> branch and source of truth, which is <code>master</code>. Every Release is a tag on master, every new development
takes place in a new branch. This makes version control incredibly easy to reason with, as there simply isn&rsquo;t too much
complexity: Master is bleeding-edge, releases are fixed points in time and code.<br>This has the additional advantage of master being a kind-of staging environment: Our CI pipeline builds after
any commit to master, which usually happens as soon as a branch is merged into it. The result is deployed to our staging
server, ready for QA to review before creating the actual release.</p><p>What has caused a little headache, though, is how to properly test feature branches. Easy for developers! They simply run
<code>docker-compose up</code> and the development stack is spun up.<br>But what about testers, product managers, eager sales colleagues? They have no chance to review a feature in development
until the dev deems it ready to merge (which it most definitely is not).</p><hr><p>This problem was bugging me more than I&rsquo;d like to admit. After lots of coffee though, I came up with a plan! Our ideal
solution should fulfill the following requirements:</p><ul><li><strong>Feature branches should be automatically deployed whenever someone commits to them.</strong> This is ideal for rapid
interaction testing (a fancy word I just made up for someone screaming &ldquo;WTF nothing works!&rdquo; across the hall and
someoneone shouting &ldquo;I just fixed it, reload the page!&rdquo; back at them).</li><li><strong>Deployments should have a unique hostname.</strong> As we&rsquo;re working with web apps used to living on the domain root, we
can&rsquo;t just put them in a subfolder without breaking things. Therefore, each branch deployment must be available in their
own subdomain (which brings additional pitfalls, more on that below).</li><li><strong>Deployments must have a valid SSL certificate and ask for credentials.</strong> Feature branches could contain sensitive
details, personal data or inappropriate jokes (ever sent <em>&ldquo;penis&rdquo;</em> to 120.000 people by accident? Yup, witnessed it), so
we must ensure only employees are able to view them.</li><li><strong>After merging branches, the server should remove their remnants.</strong> In a fast-paced environment, we create lots of
branches, most of them pretty ephemeral. To avoid cluttering the server with hundreds of obsolete versions, it should
remove stale deployments after they have been merged into master.</li></ul><p>The solution we came up with fulfills these criteria with a number of clever/imbecile (your pick) tricks!</p><h3 id=deployment-strategy class="heading heading--3"><a class=heading__anchor href=#deployment-strategy>Deployment strategy</a></h3><p>As it often goes, your initial assumptions about a problem turn out to have a small mistake somewhere, causing everything
relying on them to crumble down. With this project, deployment was the part that I had to rethink the most.</p><h4 id=iteration-1-let-the-ci-deploy-to-firebase class="heading heading--4"><a class=heading__anchor href=#iteration-1-let-the-ci-deploy-to-firebase>Iteration 1: Let the CI deploy to Firebase</a></h4><p>As we run the production and staging environments on <a class=link href=https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Firebase Hosting</a>
, I though
it&rsquo;d make the most sense to deploy branch previews to new Firebase sites, too. You can actually host multiple sites in the
sample Google Cloud project, but there&rsquo;s an upper limit of 36 websites per project. As we currently have 6 production sites up,
this leaves us with 30 available previews—not enough. I shortly looked into creating new Google Cloud projects
programmatically before deciding to abandon this approach.</p><h4 id=iteration-2-listen-to-github-webhooks-on-a-preview-server class="heading heading--4"><a class=heading__anchor href=#iteration-2-listen-to-github-webhooks-on-a-preview-server>Iteration 2: Listen to GitHub webhooks on a preview server</a></h4><p>A dedicated server it was, then. I experimented with a simple &ldquo;controller&rdquo; application written in Symfony that would listen to
GitHub webhooks, create a preview directory, check out or pull the code change and build it according to some simple rules,
maybe even a configuration file in the repository.<br>As I figured production builds would require more time than GitHub was willing to wait for the webhook response, I addded a job
queue to the application and set up a separate worker process to process queued build jobs. The worker would scan the project
structure, look for build instructions and carry it out. I even thought about dynamically running docker-compose setups to
support backend applications, too.</p><p>It took me longer than I&rsquo;d like to admit that I&rsquo;ve started to recreate our CI server.</p><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6115429/76680124-5fa8c180-65e6-11ea-9ef0-c399117b9a9c.jpeg alt=Genius.></p><p>While the application would indeed build as expected, it took ages and as several builds piled up, the server ran out of file
descriptors. After the sudden realisation that we have complex build pipelines for a reason and my whacky little
<code>if (fileExists('package.json'))</code> would <em>not</em> be enough, I scrapped the idea of the controller.</p><h4 id=iteration-3 class="heading heading--4"><a class=heading__anchor href=#iteration-3>Iteration 3:</a></h4><p>I turned back to our <a class=link href=https://buddy.works/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Buddy CI server</a>
, which I had foolishly ignored in the previous iteration. Buddy is
an <em>amazing</em> product: What previously took me hours in Jenkins (don&rsquo;t even get me started on the BlueOcean pipeline syntax) is
done in a matter of minutes on Buddy.<br>A separate pipeline was set up, configured to be limited to branches matching <code>^refs\/head\/(feature|fix)-(.+)$</code>. I decided to
have the preview server do as little CGI work as possible to reduce complexity. This demanded deploying branch build artefacts
to the correct location, within the web server root directory, up front. Therefore, I added a shell script to Buddy to build a
slug of the project and branch name:</p><div class=highlight><pre class=chroma><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span class=nb>export</span> <span class=nv>REPOSITORY</span><span class=o>=</span><span class=k>$(</span><span class=nb>echo</span> <span class=nv>$BUDDY_REPO_SLUG</span> <span class=p>|</span> cut -d<span class=s1>&#39;/&#39;</span> -f2<span class=k>)</span>
<span class=nb>export</span> <span class=nv>BRANCH</span><span class=o>=</span><span class=k>$(</span><span class=nb>echo</span> <span class=s2>&#34;</span><span class=nv>$BUDDY_EXECUTION_BRANCH</span><span class=s2>&#34;</span> <span class=p>|</span> iconv -t ascii//TRANSLIT <span class=p>|</span> sed -r s/<span class=o>[</span>^a-zA-Z0-9<span class=o>]</span>+/-/g <span class=p>|</span> sed -r s/^-+<span class=se>\|</span>-+$//g <span class=p>|</span> tr A-Z a-z<span class=k>)</span>

<span class=nb>export</span> <span class=nv>PREVIEW_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</span><span class=o>=</span><span class=nv>$REPOSITORY</span>-<span class=nv>$BRANCH</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Thankfully, Buddy already provides a slug version of the repository name (think <code>acme-inc/my-repo</code>). We split it on the slash
and take the second part of the result to get the repository name slug. Then, we &ldquo;slugify&rdquo; the current branch and append that
to the repository name.<br>This leaves us with identifiers like <code>my-repo-feature-add-foo</code>, which are ideal for URLs! After the build process is done, we deploy the content of our <code>dist/</code> directory to the remote path <code>/var/www/previews/$PREVIEW_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</code>, as Buddy supports using environment variables in deployment actions.</p><p>To sum up: Instead of wasting time needlessly managing Google Cloud API complexity or badly recreating CI servers, we take what
we have and deploy the existing artefacts to a static file server. Deployments: Check!</p><h3 id=choosing-an-url-schema class="heading heading--3"><a class=heading__anchor href=#choosing-an-url-schema>Choosing an URL schema</a></h3><p>To serve those files, we have nginx set up with the web root pointing to <code>/var/www/previews</code>. There&rsquo;s two things left to take
care of, though: Serving previews using HTTPS and limit the audience to our own employees. HTTPS is essential for CORS and
authorization—also, it&rsquo;s 2020. We have free and ubiquituous SSL thanks to Let&rsquo;s Encrypt. There&rsquo;s no excuse, not even for
internal projects.<br>Additionally, we don&rsquo;t want to expose new features to the public <em>in an uncontrolled manner</em>. This can lead to all kinds of
trouble, from exposing sensitive details to raising expectations for new stuff that is ultimately scrapped.</p><p>Now, there are several options when it comes to the schema for URLs to your previews. For example, you could place all previews
in sub-directories of your preview domain: That would look like <code>https://previews.example.org/{preview-slug}/</code>. This requires
your application to be tolerant to path changes, though.<br>Instead, I settled on second-level subdomains: <code>https://{preview-slug}.previews.example.org/</code>. While this might sound more
complex at first, it prevents the path issue and allows us to choose different webserver or CDN rules for individual previews,
if need be.</p><p>The following nginx configuration handles this setup:</p><div class=highlight><pre class=chroma><code class=language-nginx data-lang=nginx><span class=k>server</span> <span class=p>{</span>

</code></pre></div><p>This routes all requests for a subdomain into a directory named accordingly below <code>/var/www/previews</code>. If it doesn&rsquo;t exist, the
friendly 404 page at <code>/var/www/previews/404.html</code> will be served instead. If it does, we have a matching preview! To support
multiple environments, the <code>try_files</code> directive simply probes multiple common directory schemas: <code>dist/</code>, <code>build/</code> or
<code>public/</code> (more on <code>__PREVIEW_BUILD__</code> later).</p><h3 id=ssl-shenanigans class="heading heading--3"><a class=heading__anchor href=#ssl-shenanigans>SSL shenanigans</a></h3><p>I generated the SSL certificate referenced in the nginx configuration using the following command:</p><div class=highlight><pre class=chroma><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>sudo letsencrypt certonly <span class=se>\
</span><span class=se></span>    -d <span class=se>\*</span>.preview.messengerpeople.dev <span class=se>\

</span><span class=se></span>    --dns-cloudflare <span class=se>\
</span><span class=se></span>    --dns-cloudflare-credentials /etc/letsencrypt/cloudflare.ini
</code></pre></div><p>Wildcard domains as <code>*.preview.messengerpeople.dev</code> require a DNS verification. Certbot supports several plugins to perform DNS
verifications, one of them for Cloudflare. This will automatically create and delete a verification record for the domain,
which is perfect: Setup-and-forget SSL for our preview domain.<br>Now, in theory, the previews should be available on the internet already: That is, unless the domain is proxied through the
Cloudflare cache! While you can <em>create</em> wildcard records in the Cloudflare DNS and even proxy them (if you&rsquo;re at least on a
Business plan), the domain certificate still won&rsquo;t cover it; this makes using Cloudflare for the previews mostly impossible.</p><p>However, there&rsquo;s an escape hatch here! Cloudflare supports uploading custom certificates for websites on a Business plan.
We have an existing certificate from Let&rsquo;s Encrypt already, but it has a pretty low expiration time (2–3 months), so
uploading the renewed certificate every other day would be both a hassle and too error-prone.</p><p><strong>Lucky for us, the Cloudflare API allows to upload custom certificates programmatically and Let&rsquo;s Encrypt has post-renewal
hooks!</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;ve written <a class=link href=https://gist.github.com/Radiergummi/bd7a7298a6d07e76912daa06a72707c5 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">a post-renewal hook script</a>
that will take
the existing credentials from the Cloudflare DNS verification plugin and update the custom certificate with the freshly created
file right after the unattended renewal on our preview server.<br>All in all, this allows us to use a second-level subdomain, with a valid and auto-renewed SSL certificate, via the Cloudflare
Proxy.</p><h3 id=guarding-access class="heading heading--3"><a class=heading__anchor href=#guarding-access>Guarding access</a></h3><p>We could simply set up a Basic Authorization here, share a set of credentials with the company and leave the prompt to the
user browser. As we&rsquo;ve gone through all the trouble to make Cloudflare work, why not go the extra mile and defer authentication
to <a class=link href=https://teams.cloudflare.com/access/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloudflare Access</a>
? Access is an easy way to let users authenticate with their
company accounts, be it GitHub for developers or Microsoft for everyone else.<br>Set-up is pretty straight-forward once you&rsquo;ve understood the security model. After creating an access policy, you&rsquo;ll need to
restrict access to nginx to Cloudflare IP addresses, which are available from <code>https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4</code> and
<code>https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v6</code>. We have a script in place that polls the list every other day and updates an nginx snippet
included in the server configuration.
Bam! Previews are now restricted to employees.</p><h3 id=finishing-touches class="heading heading--3"><a class=heading__anchor href=#finishing-touches>Finishing touches</a></h3><p>Almost there! As we&rsquo;re working on a tool intended to be used by non-engineers too, it should have more UX than usual. Not that
developers do not deserve great UX—they do!—but a generic 404 page from nginx looks not that scary to us.<br>To make this whole thing neat and approachable, I decided to render a placeholder page as soon as the build starts and remove
it after the build completes. As Buddy also supports actions on pipeline failures, we can even override it with an error page
in case the build fails!</p><p>This merely involves another build step that writes a HEREDOC string to <code>__PREVIEW_BUILD__/index.html</code>:</p><div class=highlight><pre class=chroma><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>mkdir -p /var/www/previews/<span class=nv>$PREVIEW_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</span>/__PREVIEW_BUILD__
