as head of engineering and help them revolutionize the global manufacturing market.</strong></p><p>As it goes with most big changes in life, I didn&rsquo;t notice what was happening until all puzzle pieces were in place. My original plan for 2020 (looking back this
is a silly thing to say, with this specific year probably accounting for the highest number of cancelled plans in recent and not-so-recent history) was to start
looking at the job market around August, probably making a decision in late october, and get moving sometime before the holidays. Much more important, I wanted
to finally leave Munich and move to a new place, with a new job, and start over.<br>Not for some wild desire to burn all bridges, mind you, but merely to give the world a chance to show me something new. Being in your mid-twenties, with no
relationships, kids, or any other real obligations yet, there&rsquo;s not much reason to stay at one place for too long. That&rsquo;s what I think, at least. The world is too
big of a place to artificially limit the fraction of it I&rsquo;m going to see in my lifetime.<br>Anyway, with this plan in mind, I was laid back, waiting for events to unfold, convinced things would work out either way. Until the day Nils, my friend, neighbour,
and future colleague, asked me whether I&rsquo;d like to join their company, responsible for the entire web platform. My intuition was saying <em>&ldquo;no&rdquo;</em>, considering I had a
well-paid job and more than solid standing at MessengerPeople; despite the economically critical situation, I was pretty sure to be one of the last people being
laid off, independently of how things&rsquo;d turn out. That night, I started wondering.</p><p>Why not?</p><hr><p>Of course there&rsquo;s no reason to say no. After all, I don&rsquo;t have much to lose career-wise. The only thing I&rsquo;m trading in is the security an established company
provides, at the expense of the freedom to do whatever the fuck I deem right. If things go awry in the end, I&rsquo;m at least sure I brought this upon myself.</p></div><div class=bottom-menu><hr><nav><a href=/posts>back</a>&#183;<a href=/posts>blog</a>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/Radiergummi>github</a>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;<a href=/about>about</a>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;<a href=https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/imprint/>imprint</a>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;<a href=https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/privacy/>privacy</a>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;<a href=https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/>home</a></nav></div><div class=page-footer><script data-goatcounter=https://stats.9dev.de/count async src=https://stats.9dev.de/count.js></script><script></script></div></div></body></html>
