<span class=tag><a href=https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/tags/story>story</a></span></div><p><strong>Hello darkness, my old friend&mldr;</strong><br>This is <em>not</em> the first time I'm attempting to write regularly. As it usually happens, you start enthusiastically with a thought or twice at
the edge of your brain, eager to be put in words, thinking <em>&ldquo;Oh yeah! This time, I'm going to do it! I'm finally making a blog!"</em> &ndash; until
you actually start doing so.</p><p>Now, in my previous attempts, one of two things might happen:</p><ol><li>Burning with aforementioned vigor to write, I find myself in front of a white sheet of paper or blinking cursor, <em>completely and utterly
lost and unable to write a single word down.</em> Somehow, expressing abstract thoughts in your head is easier than capturing them in words.</li><li>Well&mldr; how would such a blog look like? I mean I know computer stuff, shouldn't it be, like, <strong>the absolute best platform there is</strong>?<br>It goes without saying, it must be implemented in the best-possible, shiniest way as to make every visitor bow before my genius! And off
I go, wasting countless hours researching current CMS platforms, end up with static site generators, start researching go templates, set
up a new Netlify account &ndash; and suddenly, all that fun about writing a blog has disappeared into thin air.</li></ol><p>So to conquer my usual ways of failing, I've attempted to fool myself by removing as much friction from the process as I can. This blog uses
<a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> and the beautiful <a href=https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam><em>Call me Sam</em> theme from Victoria Drake</a>,
which is a sane choice and most importantly <em>limits me in most ways possible</em>.<br>The only thing I can reasonably do is write Markdown posts, which is a format that comes so natural to me I use it for almost any free text
I write.</p><p>The last few years, I've been heavily invested in the tech scene. I've contributed to Open Source, read Hackernews several times a day and
put countless hours into all sorts of projects, experiments and new tech. This is still huge and important for me: I have a deep fascination
for technology and knowledge. Nevertheless, there's a certain fatigue I cannot shake off; some things just don't seem too important anymore:
Take Hugo, my static site generator, for example. I know the few-years-younger-me would have loved to get opinionated about this. Now, that
choice has become completely irrelevant to me, as long as the thing spews out valid HTML &ndash; and it does!<br>All that indifference brings a certain freedom, though: If meaningless choices don't hold me up, my mind is ready for other things.</p><p>In the end, this is probably just a sign of growing up, getting wiser. Or thinking you get wiser because otherwise getting older would be
even more frustrating than it already is. Either way, there's lots of things I need to write about, give a shape &ndash; understand.</p></div><div class="section bottom-menu"><hr><p><a href=/posts>back</a>
