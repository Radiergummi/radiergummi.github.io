. If
you suffer from even a slight proclivity to perfectionism, you will inevitably try to refactor it. While doing so, you will equally inevitably realize there&rsquo;s even
bigger fruits to reap a little further up, and before you know it you&rsquo;re rewriting the entire application. Now, the younger me might have said, &ldquo;obviously that was
necessary!&rdquo;, utterly ignoring the fact that the end result performs equally well at best, with a ridiculous amount of time having been wasted on playing a zero-sum
game.</p><p>But even without taking that work time constraint into account, there&rsquo;s a much more fundamental realisation to be made: You will never outpace the amount of &ldquo;bad&rdquo;
new code being written.<br>Even more generic: <strong>You can&rsquo;t win against entropy.</strong></p><hr><p>In nature, there is no such thing as the complete lack of movement, as <em>&ldquo;perfection&rdquo;</em>.</p><p>Yet I still strive to achieve perfection in everything I do: Despite I know it&rsquo;s ultimately futile.<br>Looking back, this has caused a lot of frustration for me, both professionally and in private. A lot of bitterness stems from my inability to accept subpar
performance, rough edges or mistakes, both in myself and in others.<br>Therefore, I&rsquo;ve decided to not only accept but embrace imperfection for what it is: perfectly normal.</p><hr><p>So to avoid going mad over this, I&rsquo;ve decided on a strategy I&rsquo;d like to employ: <em>Isles of sanity</em>.<br>Such an isle is a small part of a larger construct, say a single method in a piece of code or my apartment. It&rsquo;s a fragment of the world I can control, a thing I
can mold into whatever I consider sane. Key to this strategy is accepting the shape of this isle to be fluid: The code might be removed tomorrow, the apartment
swapped for another or shared with someone else.</p><p>I like to imagine a circle as drawn by a computer: Consisting of pixels, of squares, it can&rsquo;t ever be a real circle but merely an approximation.</p><p>As it is a very huge circle, I only ever get to work on a small part of it. So while I might manage to give that part a neatly rounded contour, I will never be able
to extend that to the whole circle. Even if I tried, entropic forces would tear down any progress I made.<br>That, however, is the advantage of my mental model. By accepting this fact and only focusing on the small arc of the circle right in front of me, I can come to
terms with myself and the surrounding chaos.</p><hr><p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure whether that will work out. We&rsquo;ll see!</p></div><div class=bottom-menu><hr><nav><a href=/posts>back</a>&#183;<a href=/posts>blog</a>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/Radiergummi>github</a>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;<a href=/about>about</a>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;<a href=https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/imprint/>imprint</a>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;<a href=https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/privacy/>privacy</a>&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;<a href=https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/>home</a></nav></div><div class=page-footer><script data-goatcounter=https://stats.9dev.de/count async src=https://stats.9dev.de/count.js></script><script></script></div></div></body></html>
