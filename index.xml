Currently, we have lots of SEO-relevant aggregation pages and public profiles we&amp;rsquo;re not immediately ready to move to the new application. These pages are automatically generated from our old application server, receive serious traffic (40k views per day), and cannot be replicated in Webflow, our new website provider.
Unfortunately, those pages are all placed on the root domain (matchory.</description></item><item><title>Portable Development Setup</title><link>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/portable-development-setup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 09:52:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/portable-development-setup/</guid><description>Due to switching jobs, and my beloved 2013-ish MacBook Pro finally failing on me for good, I&amp;rsquo;m in a somewhat unsuspected situation: The only computing devices available to me are my smartphone and an old Chromebook which Google gifted to me at MessengerPeople, so we could have a Meet coversation with their sales people.
It is a rather old and cheap model, with a slow dual core CPU and 3GB of RAM&amp;ndash;all in all, the last thing you&amp;rsquo;d probably want to do any reasonable software development on.</description></item><item><title>Change of Plans</title><link>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/change-of-plans/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 15:41:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/change-of-plans/</guid><description>Starting this september, I will join Matchory as head of engineering and help them revolutionize the global manufacturing market.
As it goes with most big changes in life, I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice what was happening until all puzzle pieces were in place. My original plan for 2020 (looking back this is a silly thing to say, with this specific year probably accounting for the highest number of cancelled plans in recent and not-so-recent history) was to start looking at the job market around August, probably making a decision in late october, and get moving sometime before the holidays.</description></item><item><title>Massively Parallel PHP</title><link>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/projects/massively-parallel-php/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2020 12:35:04 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/projects/massively-parallel-php/</guid><description>With most large software systems, sooner or later a need arises to perform certain jobs in parallel. We usually solve this problem with some sort of job queue which schedules work to be processed later, asynchronously, in a separate process. While PHP might not be the first language that jumps to mind for long-running workers, it was still the best possible choice at MessengerPeople. How so? We have a huge ecosystem of applications, shared libraries and conventions, all built with PHP.</description></item><item><title>Taking user feedback seriously</title><link>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/user-feedback/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 12:03:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/user-feedback/</guid><description>Recently, I got annoyed with the way we handle support in some cases. Users write emails or send messages via instant messaging apps, which end up in some ticket system, get assigned a priority and will be forwarded as a ticket to a support employee. Maybe they don&amp;rsquo;t have time right away because they are busy or on vacation or don&amp;rsquo;t like the customer or simply aren&amp;rsquo;t too motivated that day.</description></item><item><title>Application Framework</title><link>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/projects/application-framework/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 10:13:38 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/projects/application-framework/</guid><description>Driven by the need to reuse domain-specific code, I started working on a unified base framework for every application we run. At the time of writing, this amounts to 37 individual services, both console and web applications.
Before the lamentation starts, let me be clear on one important point: I did not build a fresh framework, of course! There&amp;rsquo;s lots of smarter people than me who have put a lot of thought into existing options.</description></item><item><title>Internal CLI</title><link>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/projects/cli/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 10:12:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/projects/cli/</guid><description>As a company grows, its infrastructure grows with it. This makes it more and more unwieldy to manage all tools involved: Status dashboards, the company CRM, cloud provider control panels and home-grown software are all required to keep the business running, and everything needs to more or less work. Sometimes, there&amp;rsquo;s a database query nobody ever cared enough about to build an interface for it: Say, archiving a customer, or checking the activity status of a bunch of customers by some arcane filter.</description></item><item><title>Rabbit MQ</title><link>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/projects/rabbitmq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 10:11:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/projects/rabbitmq/</guid><description>Whoops!

Over time, I have worked on several interesting projects here.

Usually, and especially if written by someone else, it&amp;rsquo;s awful . If you suffer from even a slight proclivity to perfectionism, you will inevitably try to refactor it. While doing so, you will equally inevitably realize there&amp;rsquo;s even bigger fruits to reap a little further up, and before you know it you&amp;rsquo;re rewriting the entire application. Now, the younger me might have said, &amp;ldquo;obviously that was necessary!&amp;rdquo;, utterly ignoring the fact that the end result performs equally well at best, with a ridiculous amount of time having been wasted on playing a zero-sum game.</description></item><item><title>Simple Cronjobs for CLI apps using systemd</title><link>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/php-cronjobs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 13:29:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/posts/php-cronjobs/</guid><description>Most applications will need some kind of asynchronous processing happening in the background: Calculating statistics, sending emails or processing large files. These tasks are probably abstracted into some kind of job queue, ready to be fetched by a worker.
Now, whenever you want to perform a task in regular intervals (say: Calculating monthly billing positions and sending them to Stripe for invoicing), you need some kind of scheduler. The most straightforward and probably most common solution is to simply create a cron job.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Policy</title><link>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2020 22:29:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/privacy/</guid><description>Preface The following text is only available in German for now, since its required by law around here, and I lack the resources to let a lawyer translate it to english.

This is not the first time I&amp;rsquo;m attempting to write regularly. As it usually happens, you start enthusiastically with a thought or twice at the edge of your brain, eager to be put in words, thinking &amp;ldquo;Oh yeah! This time, I&amp;rsquo;m going to do it! I&amp;rsquo;m finally making a blog!&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; until you actually start doing so.
Now, in my previous attempts, one of two things might happen:</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2020 20:39:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.moritzfriedrich.com/about/</guid><description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Moritz, a full-stack developer with a focus on the backend side of things. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m head of engineering at Matchory , a startup from Germany.
I usually work with PHP, Node.js and Go on the backend projects and Vue(x) for frontend stuff. The rest of my preferred tech stack includes Docker, Redis, RabbitMQ, and MySQL. I have written about some of my past projects here in more detail.</description></item></channel></rss>
